# Partisol_BAM_T640_Colo

This project includes a set of python scripts and corresponding data that can be used to generate correlation plots.
The python scripts are designed to be run on Linux and would probably have to be modified slightly to work on Windows.

Correlogram.py generates a plot like the following:
